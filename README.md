## TODO:

### Already programmed, needs cleanup, etc.
- Geometry: Points, lines, segments, convex hulls, etc.
- Sequences: binomial, stirling numbers, etc.
- Lagrange Interpolation
- Polynomials, maybe fourier transforms
- Simple matrices
- Splay trees ("ropes")
- String stuff: Suffix trees, Rabin Karp, etc.

### Not yet programmed:
- Segment Trees
- Fenwick Trees
- KD trees
- ???
